## Description
Diemos-fw acts as an abstraction layer for iptables
Diemos-fw simplifies firewall rule management by providing a clean, readable syntax. It eliminates the tedious work of writing raw iptables/nftables commands, allowing administrators to focus on designing effective security policies rather than wrestling with complex implementation details.
